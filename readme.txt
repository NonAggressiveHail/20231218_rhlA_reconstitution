20231127_gmr_effect showed that expression of aacC1 in trans did not abolish activity. It is therefore likely that removal of rhlA is what is genuinely stopping antifungal activity. To confirm this I need to reconsititute rhlA and see if activity is restored. 

In 20240108_rhlB_and_rhlC_knockouts I confirmed that rhlA is required for activity, and also saw that removing rhlB stops activity. Removing rhlC showed a small but non-significant increase in activity. I therefore also need to reconsitutre rhlB

As rhlA and rhlB are in an operon, I may as well reconstiture the entire operon into both knock-out. I can also use these primers to confirm the presence or absence of rhlAB in the Tn mutants I used in 20231117_rhlA_knockouts

Aims:
~ Check presence of rhlAB in all rhlA and rhlB knockout strains
~ Reconstitute rhlAB into both the rhlA and rhlB knockouts, to see if activity is restored
